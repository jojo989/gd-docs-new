# Sending requests

When interacting with Geometry Dash's Private API, there is a set of rules which you must follow. Failure to do that will result in the error `-1`.

## Requirements

To make a successful request to the Geometry Dash servers, there are a couple factors to consider:

- Cloudflare
- Request Type
- Rate Limits

### Cloudflare
The Geometry Dash servers are protected using a service called [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). In order to send a successful request, bypassing cloudflare is essential. In order to that, you must:

- send the request to the `www.` subdomain,
- send the request with an empty user-agent.

If you don't follow these steps, cloudflare will block the request and you will recieve an HTTP error code: `1020`

### Request Type
In 99% of cases, Geometry Dash requires you to send a `POST` request. The request parameters require the following header: `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

### Rate Limits
Sending too many requests at a given time will result in you becoming rate limited and not being able to send any more requests for a certain duration. As the number of requests required to start a rate limit changes, we are unable to provide exact numbers, but as of November 3rd, 2023, they are roughly:
- 20x downloadGJLevel per minute, all other data-retrieval endpoints - 2 per second

However, there are some longer-term limits applied on top of that as well.

## Alternative method
As of May 31st, 2023, an alternative method is using IPv6 to interact with the servers:

```cmd
curl http://[2600:3c03::f03c:91ff:fe69:863b]/database/getGJLevels21.php -X POST -d secret=Wmfd2893gb7
```
```py
